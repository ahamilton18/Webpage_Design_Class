		<h1>Welcome to Abby's web page!</h1>
		<hr />
		
		<p>I was born September 28, 1999. I grew up in Oxford, PA which 
		is very rural. I live next to an amish farm! It takes me 45 minutes
		to get to school everyday.</p>
		<p>I attended Penns Grove Middle School which is in the Oxford Area 
		School district. I really like math and science. I want to major in 
		biology and then attend vet school to be an equine veterinarian.</p>
		<p>I am on <b>Padua's field hockey team</b> and am a varsity captain, 
		the link is <a href="http://www.pandassports.com/page9016" target="_blank">here</a>!  
		I also ride horses and have been riding since I was 6. I enjoy reading 
		when I have time. My favorite tv show is Grey's Anatomy and I briefly 
		considered being a doctor after starting to watch the show! My favorite 
		movie is <i>Sing</i>, which is about a Koala who is determined to own 
		a successful theater. My favorite quote is...</p> 
		
		<blockquote>"Good things come to those who believe, better things
		come to those who are patient, and the best things come to those who don't
		give up."</blockquote>
