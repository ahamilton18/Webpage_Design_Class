	       			<p>The Sand Cat, also known as the Sand Dune Cat, is a particularly elusive 
	       		species that is found living in the Sahara, the Arabian Peninsula and parts of 
	       		central Asia. It is the only cat living mainly in desert environments. Even with 
	       		their wide range, there is very little known about the species. They are very stealthy 
	       		and spend days in burrows only coming out at night to hunt desert rodents. The cat can 
	       		survive in temperatures ranging from −5 °C (23 °F) to 52 °C (126 °F) and retreats 
	       		into burrows during extreme conditions. Although it will drink when water is available, 
	       		the Sand Cat is able to survive for months on the body fluids in its prey. Sand Cats are 
	    		specially adapted to this lifestyle. The pads on their paws are smooth, soft, and furry 
	    		which leaves virtually no tracks in their sandy environment and protects their feet from 
	    		the elements. Also their tan coat color provides perfect desert camouflage. The species 
	    		has learned to crouch down and close their eyes when light shines on them, so it is very 
	       		difficult to track them. While all of these traits are great desert survival tools,
	       		it makes species conservation very difficult. </p>
	       		
	       	<h2>Sand Cat Kittens Filmed for First Time in the Wild</h2> <!-- This paragraph includes a video
	       	link to watch the Sand Kittens filmed for the first time in the wild --!>
	       			<p>After four years of extensive research on the Sand Cat and five expeditions
	       		to Africa, researchers from the wild cat conservation group, "Panthera", found
	       		and photographed three kittens in Morocco. The elusive kittens were documented 
	       		sitting under a bush in the Moroccan Sahara at about 2am on April 26th. The 
	       		kittens had likely been placed there by their mother while she went off to hunt.
	       		The kittens were estimated to be between 6 and 8 weeks old. The team from Panthera
	       		photographed and filmed the Sand Cat kittens for about an hour and installed some 
	       		camera traps to record their natural behavior. The video can be seen 
	       		<a href="https://youtu.be/tGdL-34L-GE" target="_blank"><b>here</b>.</a> Amazingly, the 
	       		researchers also later observed an agitated adult female sand cat that they speculated
	       		was the mother of the kittens. They seized the opportunity and radio-collared her, 
	       		which will add to the very little confirmed research on the Sand Cat.</p>

	       	<h2>Challenges with Conservation and What is Being Done</h2>
	       			<p>As previously mentioned, the traits that make the Sand Cat so well adapted
	       		to survive in its environment, also make it very difficult to manage their
	       		conservation. Gathering an accurate count of the species may be the most difficult
	       		part. Just last year, researchers in the United Arab Emirates made news when they 
	       		announced they’d photographed sand cats in that country for the first time in a decade.
	       		Preliminary results show that the cats range much more widely than previously believed 
	       		and are picky about their habitat. There are also likely fewer cats than scientists 
	       		had previously estimated. The recent publicity that has been associated with this 
	       		species could also be a cause for concern. People are infatuated with the 
	       		animal's cuteness and many expressed an interest in getting their own sand cat 
	       		after seeing the video. In some areas the cats are already being captured and sold 
	       		to animal collectors. The Panthera team released a public statement saying, "We are 
	       		strongly against this practice and it would lead to the direct opposite of our goal 
	       		of creating awareness and protection for the species in the wild.”</p>
	       			<p>Habitat degration is another major threat for the Sand Cat species. Vulnerable 
	       		arid ecosystems are being rapidly degraded by human settlement and activity, 
	       		especially livestock grazing. The prey of the Sand Cat is highly dependent on the 
	       		presence of adequate vegetation, which may experience large fluctuations due to 
	       		drought or declines due to desertification and loss of natural vegetation. They also 
	       		may be killed in traps laid out by inhabitants of oases targeting foxes and jackals or 
	       		in retaliation for killing their chickens.</p>
