	<h3>History</h3>
	<!--This section uses paragraph format to provide a narative of the history of Eastern 
	State-->
		<p>This halloween, travel to the spookiest, most haunted place the United States. 
		The building that was once home to the most famous and expensive prison in the world
		is now open for your horror experience. Eastern State was the first true "penitentiary"
		and is known for the true regret it inspired in the hearts of its prinsoners through
		torturous tactics. The prison once contained some of America's most notorious prisoners 
		such as "Slick Willie" Sutton and Al Capone.</p>
		<p>The prison is haunted by the spirits of the inmates who lived and died within its
		walls. These inmates were kept in complete solitary, which led to serious mental illness.
		The penitentiary was founded as a place where criminals would find God, but in reality
		they only grew further from him.

	<h3>Torture at the Penitentiary</h3>
	<!--A list is used here because it was the best format to display the various methods of torture-->
		<ul>
			<li>Water Bath method: Inmates who misbehaved were dunked in icy water, then hung on 
			the wall and left alone for the night. In the winter this punishment was worse because 
			ice would form on the prisoner's skin as the temperature dipped below freezing.</li>
			<li>Iron Gag: This punishment was used on inmates who ignored the no communication policy.
			An iron collar was secured around the tongue and chains were attached that were shackled 
			to each wrist. If the inmate moved enough, their tongue would be ripped. Very often the
			inmate bled enough that they died and the collar was never removed.</li>
			<li>Mad Chair: Inmate is strapped into a chair with leather straps and left for days 
			without rations. By the end circulation would nearly stop due to the suffocating straps. </li>
			<li>The Hole: A deep, lightless, airless pit dug under block #14 that inmates would be
			placed in for days and sometimes weeks with minimal amounts of bread and water to survive.
			They competed with rats and other pests for this food supple</li> 
		</ul>

	<h3>Accounts of Paranormal Activity</h3>
		<p>One locksmith tells a particularly terrifying tale of his experience at the penitentiary. He
		was working to remove a 140 year old lock from a cell door when suddenly he was immobilized. 
		Tortured faces appeared on the walls and shifting forms circled around him in the cell
		block, while one of them seemed to call to the locksmith. Many people believe that the force 
		that made him unable to move was the escaping ghosts of the prisoners.</p>
	
	<h3>What other travelers are saying</h3>
	<!--In this section I am using block quotes in italics to display the traveler reviews, this format
	mimics the format often used on travel sites to review destinations-->
		<p>
		<blockquote><i>Eastern States penitentiary is nothing less than creepy and disturbing. The 
		atmosphere almost makes ones skin crawl. I can believe that it is haunted. Not only do you 
		get to see what was a 'model' of prison buildings but also the place that housed many famous 
		gangsters. This is a must see if you are in Philadelphia. You can walk there from any of the 
		center city hotels. Go see it!!

		<blockquote><i>This is the second time we have visited Eastern State and we still did not 
		experience it all. Experience is the word for it as it takes you back to a different time as 
		you feel the pain and suffering that occurred here. Give yourself extra time and take advantage 
		of the mini tours that are being offered. Can you feel the ghosts of Eastern State? You be the 
		judge.

		<blockquote><i>It was a learning curve....A deep insight into how the world penitentiary system 
		came about and how the study of the mind and human behavior developed during those years. The 
		audio tour is very very comprehensive and very simple to understand....10 out of 10 for this visit!
